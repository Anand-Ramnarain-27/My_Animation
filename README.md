# My_Animation

The animation is a 15-second project created using Blender as part of an exam project. The objective was to rig and animate given characters to match a provided audio clip, while also creating the surrounding environment. The central focus of the animation is a bench, upon which two characters are seated, engaging in a conversation.

This short animation showcases the culmination of skills in character rigging, animation, and some asset creation within the constraints of a 15-second animation project. Through meticulous planning and execution, the animation successfully brings the characters to life, in  capturing a brief yet engaging moment in their interaction.
